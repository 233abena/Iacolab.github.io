## Breast Cancer
<img src="/images/IacoLab_1.png" alt="Image" style="width:300px;">

For Hispanic women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Hispanic cancer patients in the U.S. also report worse cancer-related symptom burden and health-related quality of life than many other groups, as well as difficulty gaining access to support services due to obstacles such as cost, lack of insurance coverage, and time constraints. However, widespread smartphone use among Hispanics presents a unique opportunity for us to leverage smartphone technology to overcome these barriers.

This study aims to create and evaluate Mi Guía (My Guide), a culturally informed eHealth psychoeducational and psychosocial intervention for English or Spanish-speaking Hispanic women completing active treatment for breast cancer. Mi Guía is grounded in evidence-based paradigms to improve cancer-related symptom burden and health-related quality of life. In the first phase of the project, we will create Mi Guía and refine the intervention using usability and feasibility testing. In the second phase of the project, we will examine each component of Mi Guía for its effect on cancer-related symptom burden and health-related quality of life.
